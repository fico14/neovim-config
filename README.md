# neovim-config
neovim config for work

Prerequisites:
1) Installed NeoVim (some newer version because maybe some plugins aren't compatible with older versions)
2) A nice Linux working environment ;)

Usage:
1) Save your old NeoVim config and plugins
2) Clone this repo in your ~/.config/ directory with:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:fico14/neovim-config.git nvim
    ```
3) Run backup_nvim.sh that clones all plugins at correct location
4) Enjoy your NeoVim setup!
